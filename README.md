# Scalable Chat App

Welcome to the Scalable Chat App, a realtime socket application leveraging the power of Redis on the Aiven cloud platform.
This project showcases the implementation of a scalable and efficient chat application, providing a seamless and responsive user experience.

## Key Features:

 Realtime Communication: Harnessing the capabilities of Redis PubSub architecture,
 our chat app ensures instant communication,
 allowing users to exchange messages in realtime.

 Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, the application can handle a growing number of users
 and messages by utilizing Redis to distribute messages efficiently across multiple instances.

 Aiven Cloud Integration: By utilizing the Aiven cloud platform, we ensure a robust and reliable infrastructure for hosting our realtime chat application.
 Aiven provides a secure and managed environment, allowing us to focus on delivering a superior user experience.
